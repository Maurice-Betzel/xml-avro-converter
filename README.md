# xml-avro-converter

`xml-avro-converter` provides a framework for translating XML schemas and data into an equivalent, yet more efficient, [Avro] format. This enables transmission and storage of the same data while using less bandwidth and disk space. The Avro formatted-data
can also be translated back into the equivalent XML data if desired. Data being converted from XML to Avro or vice versa is mediated through creation of Java objects from a single set of Java classes generated by the XML schema, so no additional
translation software or XSLT-style sheets are needed to map data values between the two formats.

`xml-avro-converter` uses Avro's `ReflectData` class to generate a schema from a class on the classpath. `ReflectData` does not natively support adding inherited types to an Avro schema. `xml-avro-converter` resolves this by providing an interface to
automatically modify the schema to accommodate inherited types. All that is required is a one-line declaration for each inherited type, and `xml-avro-converter` will replace all instances of the base type in the schema with a union for that type and all
the subtypes which have been declared. This enables developers to quickly create an Avro schema from an existing Java class hierarchy, even when the Java class hierarchy uses polymorphic types.

This enables `xml-avro-converter` to generate a full Avro schema from a a Java class hierarchy which is created using [JAXB]. JAXB can be used to generate a Java class hierarchy from a set of XML schema definitions, and this Java class hierarchy can be
used to create an Avro schema - thus enabling creating an Avro schema from an XML schema. To convert data, JAXB can be used to deserialize XML documents into Java objects, and then these Java objects can be serialized using the Avro library and the
generated Avro schema. The reverse process can be achieved as well, converting Avro data into Java objects and then into XML.

Since this process uses the same Java class hierarchy, schema and data conversion can often be achieved without the need to write any translation logic at all. However, there are certain situations where users must guide the conversion process. Where JAXB
takes advantage of Java's inheritance model, users must find and declare inherited types to guide the schema to accommodate these inherited types. And in some cases, JAXB will generate generic `JAXBElement<>` types to wrap certain member variables when
Java's object model cannot capture the full expressiveness of XML's element model - in these cases, users must manually define the portions of the schema and translation logic of these specific elements. Several examples follow which demonstrate this
functionality.

# Navigating the Source Code

`xml-avro-converter`'s functional source code resides entirely in `xml-avro-converter-core`. The three main classes that users interact with are `AvroSchemaGenerator`, `AvroSerializer`, and `XmlSerializer`.

* [AvroSchemaGenerator.java] implements the logic for adding inherited types to the Avro schema. It exposes the API for declaring inherited types and re-generating the schema with those types. Users are expected to use this class to create an Avro schema
  which will then be used to create an `AvroSerializer`.

* [AvroSerializer.java] is instantiated with this schema and, optionally, a `ReflectData` instance. When writing data to Avro, it uses the `ReflectData` instance to create a `DatumWriter`, and then uses the `DatumWriter` to write the data to the
  provided `OutputStream`. It does the same when reading Avro data from an `InputStream`, using the `ReflectData` instance to create a `DatumReader`.

* [XmlSerializer.java] is instantiated with a `JAXBContext` and XML schema which the user must provide. It has utility methods to create JAXB `Marshaller`s and `Unmarshaller`s. `XmlSerializer` also provides methods for specifying a `NamespacePrefixMapper`,
  which allows the user to specify more convenient XML namespace prefixes, such as <xsd:schema/> instead of `<ns2:schema/>`.

* [AvroSchemaIterator.java] is an internal utility class which is used by `AvroSchemaGenerator` to iterate over all the `Schema`s in an Avro `Schema`.

* [SchemaGenerationException.java] is a specific class for raising `RuntimeException`s. It is thrown when an unexpected input occurs such as when users try to set fields for a non-named schema or declare an inherited type which doesn't exist.
